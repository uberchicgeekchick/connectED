To build GTK-PHP-IDE on a 64bit system:
running the ./configure script as normal
then cd into the core source directory:
`cd src`
then run `make` & `make install` from here

This is a bug with the version of gtkscintilla that is currently being used.
I am working on an upgrade, but for now here is a decent work around.

Sorry about the extra steps. If you can help I am in dire need of it.
So please feel free to email me: uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com

Thnx & please enjoy,
