 --- GtkScintilla2 - A wrapper for the Scintilla editing component ---

  This is GtkScintilla2, a wrapper for the Scintilla (www.scintilla.org) source
code editing component wich adds some facility to this powerful component
written by Neil Hodgson (and may others).


Scintilla has two little problems:
 - It is available only as a static library
 - It has a strange (for Linux/GTK+ people) API

GtkScintilla2 addresses both:
 - It is a shared library
 - It is a true GtkWidget subclass with a GTK+2 API


  Since I'm not a very good programmer and I am moving my firsts steps in
C/Linux/GTK+2/GNOME2 you should have a little patience and help me in reporting
bugs (solutions are better ;) or pointing out things that should be done in a
different way.

  There is no documentation for GtkScintilla2 yet, but the function names are
very close to Scintilla's signals so you can use native Scintilla's documents.


 --- Building and installing GtkScintilla2 ---

You don't need to download Scintilla2, its source is included in
GtkScintilla.

Step by step:
 # tar xvzf GtkScintilla2-x.x.tar.gz
 # cd GtkScintilla2-x.x
 # make
 # su
 $ make install
 $ /sbin/ldconfig
 $ exit

That's all folks!
