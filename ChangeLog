	* src/main_window_callbacks.c: on_open1_activate,
	on_save_as1_activate, on_rename1_activate, &
	display_file_selection_dialog
		I created display_file_selection_dialog to handle the actual
		creation & display of open or save dialogs the other 3 methods
		now call my new method when opening, saving, or renaming
		files.  As a result of this, actually motivation behind doing
		this is so that now when renaming files the dialog now opens
		to the current file name's path.  It was triggering an error
		and opening to one's home directory.

	* src/main_window_callbacks.c: on_about1_activate
		I have fixed the about dialog so it now shows my information &
		uses the correct svg icon.
	
	* README: created, TOC, and began writing.
		I order my projects details, lisences, RPL, information, and I
		added a list of dependacies, and a rough install quide.

	* src/find_replace.c: replace_all_clicked
		I fixed it so 'Find and Replace all actually does what it says
		and bonus it no longer segfaults when it tries.  Now it works
		& stays running afterword.
