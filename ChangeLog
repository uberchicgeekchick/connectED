	* ./Makefile.in, ./Makefile.am, ./src/Makefile.in, ./src/Makefile.am, &
	./src/gtkscintilla2/Makefile ./src/gtkscintilla2/scintilla/gtk/Makefile
		I have improved the build process so that gtkscintilla is built as part
		of connectED's build process.  This is for compatibility, connectED's
		performance, and to ensure connectED compiles on all possible Linux
		platforms.

	* ./configure & ./configure.in: added dependency to libglade-2.0
		I am implimenting libglade-2.0 in connectED.  This will be a
		huge process & I am only getting started.
	
	* src/classbrowser.c: get_member_function_completion_list
		This was at times appending to a NULL string.  Now it simply
		returns an empty string.  This does need to be improved though
		because the memory created in this method is never being
		released.
	
	* src/classbrowser.c & src/main_window_callbacks.c: [all source]
		I've basically rewrote both of these files.  I've improved the
		efficiancy of all of the methods & removed most unused
		arguments.  I've drastically improved the performance of these
		methods.  I have also updated the callbacks & signal connections
		to use the new g_object methods instead of the depricated calls
		to their formor gtk counter parts.
	
	* src/main_window.c & src/main.c: misc methods
		I have updated the callbacks & signal connections
		to use the new g_object methods instead of the depricated calls
		to their formor gtk counter parts.
	
	* src/*.c: misc methods
		I'm updating connectED to use gobject & libglade.  There are a
		lot of improvements that need to be put in place & I am slowly
		working at them.

	* src/main_window_callbacks.c: on_open1_activate,
		on_save_as1_activate, on_rename1_activate, &
		display_file_selection_dialog


2009-03-09:Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>
	* src/main_window_callbacks.c: on_about1_activate
		I have fixed the about dialog so it now shows my information &
		uses the correct svg icon.
	
	* README: created, TOC, and began writing.
		I order my projects details, lisences, RPL, information, and I
		added a list of dependacies, and a rough install quide.

	* ChangeLog: Created for release of version 1.0.0.1

2009-02-05:Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>
	* src/find_replace.c: replace_all_clicked
		I fixed it so 'Find and Replace all actually does what it says
		and bonus it no longer segfaults when it tries.  Now it works
		& stays running afterword.
