	By default connectED looks for PHP's manual under:

		e.g: /usr/share/doc/phpmanual -or- /usr/share/doc/phpdoc/html
	
	If you have PHP's manual installed in another location
	you may specify its path by passing the path to connectED's
	./configure script's '--enable-php-manual=' option.
	e.g.: /opt/php/manual/php-5.3.2
